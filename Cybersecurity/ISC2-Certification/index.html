        </li>
        <li>Confidentiality
            <ul>
                <li>Confidentiality means that no private information has been disclosed to unauthorized individuals</li>
                <li>Confidentiality is hard balance to achive, that's why we need data classification</li>
                <li>Personally Identifiable Information(PII)
                    (e.g., name,address,social security number or other identifying number or code, telephone number, email address, etc.)
                </li>

                <li>Authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources</li>
                <li>Authentication is confirming the identity of the subject. Once a subject has been authenticated, the system checks its Authorization to see if it is allowed to complete the action it is attempting.</li>

    <b>Domain1 Module3:Understand Security Controls(safe guards)</b>
    <ul>
        <li>What are Security Controls?
            <ul>
                <li><u>Security controls</u> pertain to the <u>physical</u>,<u>technical</u> and <u>administrative</u> mechanisms that 
                act as safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity and 
                availability of the system and its information. The implementation of controls should reduce risk, hopefully to an acceptable level.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Physical Controls
            <ul>
                <li><u>Physical Security Controls</u> implemented through a tangible mechanism
                <br>They typically provide ways of controlling, directing or preventing the movement of people and equipment throughout a specific physical location</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Technical Controls (also called logical controls)
            <ul>
                <li>are security controls that computer systems and networks directly implement. <br>
                They typically provide ways of controlling, directing or preventing the movement of people and equipment throughout a specific physical location
                <br>Technical controls can be configuration settings or parameters stored as data, maneged through a software graphical user interface (GUI), or they can be hardware settings done with switches, jumper plugs or other means.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Administrative Controls (also called managerial controls)
            <ul>
                <li>are directives, guidelines or advisories aimed at the people within the organization. <br>
                They typically provide ways of controlling, directing or preventing the movement of people and equipment throughout a specific physical location <br>
                Should be powerful, effective tools for achieving information security. <br>
